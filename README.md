## Change Detection Strategies
The purpose of change detection is essentially the possibility to make changes of componentsâ€™ properties (i.e. data model) reflected in the DOM.
Angular provides two change detection strategies: Default and OnPush. 

### Default Change Detection Strategy
Angular executes change detection on the entire component tree. 
Angular will skip descendant component subtrees with roots using OnPush, which have not received new inputs.

### OnPush Change Detection Strategy
OnPush change detection instructs Angular to run change detection for a component subtree only when:

- The root component of the subtree receives new inputs as the result of a template binding. Angular compares the current and past value of the input with == operator.
- Angular handles an event (for example using event binding, output binding, or @HostListener ) in the subtree's root component or any of its children whether they are using OnPush change detection or not.
- Developers can manually trigger change detection using Angular's `ChangeDetectorRef` service. This is useful for scenarios where changes occur outside of Angular's default change detection mechanisms (e.g., asynchronous operations).

### Demonstration

#### Child #1 (OnPush change detection strategy):
- Despite the fact that the input property `childObjectData` has a default value, the parent component passes a new value, 
which is displayed in the UI of the child component, after the parent updates the value in the `parentObjectData.value` field,
the child component does not trigger change detection if the input has not changed, there still a reference to the same object.
So, the model in controller has been changed, but the view has not been updated.
Input property `childPrimitiveData` of the child component does not change because the parent component does not pass anything to the input.

#### Child #2 (OnPush change detection strategy):
- The parent component passes a new object to the child component, which is displayed in the UI of the child component, 
after the parent updates the value in the `parentObjectData.value` AND `childPrimitiveData` fields, the child component trigger change detection (!), 
it happens because the parent component passes a new value to the input property `childPrimitiveData` of the child component.
So, the model in controller has been changed, and the view has been updated.

#### Child #3 (Default change detection strategy):
- The parent component passes a new object to the child component, which is displayed in the UI of the child component,
every time the parent updates the value in the `parentObjectData.value` or `childPrimitiveData` fields,
the child component trigger change detection (!). So, the model in controller has been changed, and the view has been updated on every change of `parentObjectData.value` (!!).

### How Change Detection Strategy impact app performance

#### Default Change Detection Strategy is suitable for:
- Small to Medium Applications: Suitable for applications with a relatively small number of components where performance is not a critical concern.
- Rapid Development: Ideal for rapid development and prototyping, where ease of use and simplicity are prioritized over performance optimization.

#### OnPush Change Detection Strategy is suitable for:
- Large Applications: Suitable for large applications with many components where performance is a critical concern.
- Performance Optimization: Ideal for performance-sensitive parts of the application, such as frequently updated lists or complex UI components.
- Immutable Data: Works well with applications that use immutable data structures or state management libraries like NgRx.

### Conclusion
The OnPush change detection strategy can significantly improve the performance of Angular applications by reducing the number of change detection cycles and DOM updates.
